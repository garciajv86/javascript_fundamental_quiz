# JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz

## Description
My task was to create a quiz focused on JavaScript related questions that is timed, and keeps records of the users high scores and initials so
the user can gauge his/her progress compared to the users peers. I've learnt so much from this project, one of my biggest challenges I faced in this project
was learning to use the local storage! But I think with time and practice it will become second nature. 

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
