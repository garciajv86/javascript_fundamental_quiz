# JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz

## Description
My task was to create a quiz focused on JavaScript related questions that is timed, and keeps records of the users high scores and initials so
the user can gauge his/her progress compared to the users peers. I've learnt so much from this project, one of my biggest challenges I faced in this project
was learning to use the local storage!
